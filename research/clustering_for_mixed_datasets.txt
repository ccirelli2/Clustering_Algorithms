Jaccard Index / Coefficient ---------------------------------------------------
REF:  https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/jaccard-index/

Description: The Jaccard similarity index compares members of two sets to see 
which members are shared and which are distant.  
Measure of similarity ranges from 0-100%. 
Calculation:  Jaccard Index = (number in both sets) / (number in either set)*100
			  J(X,Y) = |XnY| / |XuY|
Steps:
	Count the number of members which are shared between both sets
	Count the total number of members in both sets (shared and unshared)
	Divide the number of shared members by the number of members
	Multiply the number by 100. 

Interpretation:  Two sets that share all members would be 100% similar. 

Example:	A 		= {0,1,2,5,6}
			B 		= {0,2,3,4,5,7,9}
			|AnB| 	= {0,2,5}
			|AuB|	= {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9}
			J(X,Y)  = ((3/9)*100) = 33%


Manhattan Similarity -----------------------------------------------------------
REF:  https://dataaspirant.com/2015/04/11/five-most-popular-similarity-measures-
implementation-in-python/
REF:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry

Description:	Measures the distance between two points along axes as right angle
		Think of it as the distance you would need to walk if you 
		could only walk along the x-axis and y-axis at 0 and 90 degrees. 
Calculation:	|x1-x2| + |y1-y2|


Dissimilarity Matrix:  How far apart or distant points are from each other, 
which is the core of clustering. 
Gower Distance:  Is a distance measure that can be used to calculate distance between 
two entities whose attributes are a mix of categorical and numerical values.  


Gower Coefficient -------------------------------------------------------------
REF: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/simplifying-gower-coefficient-vineet-tanna/

Description:	Approach to finding the similarity between two rows of a dataset.
		consisting of mixed type attributes/data.  It utilizes matching
		for categorical variables, manhattan similarity for continous
		variables and Jaccard similarity for Binary variables. 
Desc 2		Relative to the maximum possible absolute (unsigned) discrepancy 
		between the two pairs of observations, the gower discrepancy 
		coefficient indicates the % average absolute discrepancy between 
		all pairs of observations. When expressed as a similarity 
		coefficient (by subtracting it from 1), it indicates the % 
		average similarity between all pairs of observations.
		Given a gower coefficeint of 0.9 indicates that relative to the max
		possible discrepancy between them, the observations agree with
		90% of each others values. 		

Application:	Used for clustering similar rows with mixed attributes. 
		K-prototype clustering technique uses gower similarity. 
Formula:	Sij = sigma(Wijk * Sijk) / sigma(Wijk)
		Sijk		denotes the contribution by the k-th variable
		Wijk		is usually 1 or 0 depending if the comparison is valid for the k-th
				variable. 


Disimilarity Matrix ------------------------------------------------------------
REF:  https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Data_Mining_Algorithms_In_R/Clustering/Dissimilarity_Matrix_Calculation

Description:	The dissimilarity matrix is a matrix that expresses the similarity pair to pair
		between two sets.  It is square and symmetric. 
		The diagonal members are defined as zero, meaning that zero is the measure of
		disimlarity between an element and itself.
		Similarity is a key concept for Clustering, in the way to decide which clusters
		should be combined or divided when observing sets. 
Use:		The dissimilarity matrix (or distance matrix) is used in many algorithms of
		density-based and hierarchical clustering, like LSDBC
R implementation
