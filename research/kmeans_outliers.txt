# How to deal with outliers
Ref:  http://www.mit.edu/~9.54/fall14/slides/Class13.pdf

Outliers:	Since K-means looks for the center of a given cluster of data, 
			it is very succeptible to outliers, which can create unintended
			and undesireable clusters.

1.	Remove the outliers. 
2.	Perform random sampling by choosing a small subset of datapoints where
	the chance of selecting an outlier is much smaller.
